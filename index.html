        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>During this semester of the Personal Development subject, I had an enjoyable time directing all the activities, which allowed me to discover more about my personality. This module was an eye-opener, helping me realize strengths and traits I wasn't fully aware of before. The experience was both fun and insightful, giving me a deeper understanding of myself and how I interact with others. I truly hope that more opportunities like this come up in the future, as they provide valuable personal growth and learning experiences. Iâ€™m looking forward to participating in similar activities that challenge and reveal more about who I am.</p>
